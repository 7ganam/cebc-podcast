My name is Ahmed Samir and I&rsquo;ll be hosting today&rsquo;s episode. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For today&rsquo;s episode, we will focus on a very critical and important topic. Today we will be speaking about the people&rsquo;s mobility behavior and specifically on the, so called, &ldquo;car pride.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m very pleased to have a very special guest today, Dr. Joanna Moody. Hi Joanna! Pleasure to have you. Could you please tell us a little about yourself and the work that you do at MIT Energy Initiative?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Joanna Moody (JM):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hi. Thank you, Ahmed. My name is Joanna Moody and I am the Research Program Manager for MIT Energy Initiative&rsquo;s Mobility Systems Center. I&rsquo;m really excited to be here to talk with you today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Thank you. Always a pleasure having you, Joanna, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to our discussion. So let&rsquo;s get started. What exactly is that &ldquo;car pride&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So I define &ldquo;car pride&rdquo; as the attribution of social status and personal image to owning and using a car. And so it&rsquo;s really about the symbolic value that a car has. And that value has, sort of, two facets. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One [is] what it says about yourself. So, for example, if I&rsquo;m in the U.S. and I drive a pick-up truck, what does that, sort of, say about the ruggedness of my job or where I live and work. If I drive a minivan or a family SUV what does that say about my image and, sort of, what I believe about myself, what I want other people to see about myself, and what I care about: my family, for example. And so the type of vehicle that you have, the fact that you own a vehicle [at all], that says something about who you are to other individuals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there is also a social status aspect and I think this is extremely important when you start to look at countries where motorization rates are lower now, but are accelerating. And really here, as incomes grow, the car is an aspirational good. It is a symbol of success, of wealth. And so there is this sense that owning a car shows that you&rsquo;ve achieved some level of success compared to, potentially, others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Wow. That&rsquo;s quite interesting. So Joanna, could you tell us a little bit more about this research? What factors did you consider to give the car pride score? . Perhaps could you also compare between the United States and the Middle Eastern countries&mdash;that would be really interesting to know.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. So our work has looked at how do we measure car pride and we have done this in two different settings. So, the first is actually across countries. And there we actually surveyed in 50 different countries, across many different continents, different levels of economic development. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the country-level car pride, we had a survey that consists of 12 different statements. And these statements are things like &ldquo;A car is an important part of my personal image.&rdquo; And these statements were defined, tested, and refined through a number of survey instruments, but in general, they were designed to capture two facets of pride that were well-established in the social psychology literature that talks about pride as a construct in general. And also to cover those two facets of pride attached to both car ownership and to car use. And those two facets of pride are somewhat related to, sort of, this personal image versus social status. Although in the social psychology literature they are called &ldquo;hubristic&rdquo; pride, which is sort of about the social comparative aspects of pride&mdash;what does it say about me relative to others? And then there is also the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; pride, which is more about the personal image&mdash;what does it say about myself to myself and how does it match my own image of myself. Those are the two facets of pride that are fairly well established in the social psychology space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">What countries did you cover and if there are any MENA countries included? Perhaps could you also compare between the United States and the Middle Eastern countries&mdash;that would be really interesting to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM: </span><span class="c1">what we found was, in general, developing countries have higher car pride, controlling for other aspects like the income of individuals, how urban their living situations are, etc. So once you take out the fact that you have different types of individuals living in different countries, there is still some residual level of national car pride. And here we see it is higher in developing countries. And, sort of, this is, I think, really reflective of that aspirational piece of car pride&mdash;the fact that the car really is this symbol of economic attainment in areas where car ownership levels are fairly low. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, in particular, in MENA what we found was that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was one of the highest car pride countries in our sample&mdash;actually, only second to Kenya in Africa for the highest level of country car pride. A couple of other countries from the MENA region were included in the survey&mdash;Morocco and Saudi Arabia, for example, were also included. They are slightly lower than UAE in terms of their car pride, but again, in general, higher than most of the developed countries in Europe as well as Japan and South Korea that were surveyed. For developed countries, the United States is, potentially unsurprisingly, the highest car pride country of the developed countries in our sample. And so I think that, even though we are looking at most of the developed countries being fairly low, the U.S. is still an outlier&mdash;we really do have a very strong car culture and personal symbolic attachment to our cars, in general, that is reflected in this survey as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Yeah. This is very shocking to me, to be honest. And of course, it is very unfortunate. So how do you see the impact of this car pride on car ownership? Do you see it impacting people&rsquo;s decisions to purchase a car?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yeah. That&rsquo;s a great question. I&rsquo;ll start with the U.S. where we really have a little more detailed data from specific cities. And we have a couple of surveys from New York City and Houston Texas, which were chosen as two very different metropolitan areas of the United States. And there we actually found surprisingly similar results across both of those, sort of, subsamples&mdash;so, across both individuals in New York and in Houston. What we found was that, if you have higher car pride, you are much more likely to own a car. So we do find that the symbolic attachment that people attach to cars drives car ownership. And that if you own a car, you are much more likely to drive it. That&rsquo;s a well-established relationship. But then actually, if you drive your car more, it reinforces your car pride. And so, here, it&rsquo;s about the fact that the more you drive, the more you interact with that car, the stronger you build a symbolic relationship with that vehicle. And so, actually, there is a reinforcing cycle here, where higher car pride means you are more likely to purchase a car; you own a car and you are more likely to drive more; you drive more and you build greater car pride. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, there are different ways in which we can, sort of, break that cycle of attitude-behavior relationships and one of those is maybe targeting the attitudes of individuals before they ever purchase a car. So, whether they are younger and have yet to make that decision or at the time when people are getting rid of a car&mdash;do they really need to be replacing it or are there alternatives (particularly if they live in an urban environment).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the MENA region, we didn&rsquo;t have nearly as detailed data to be able to do this full causal modeling. But we do find that there is a strong correlation, again, between an individual&rsquo;s car pride and whether or not they are a car owner. And, again, this is really strong in the UAE, but we see it echoed in Morocco, in Saudi Arabia, and the other countries that we have in the sample in the MENA region. And so what we find there is, again, high car pride really being correlated with high car ownership and indeed with greater car use. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">So what exactly are the motivations behind this car pride? Did your survey look into this? It would be very helpful to understand the reasons behind such behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM: </span><span class="c1">Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a great question. And in the international survey we really were going for&mdash;again, we surveyed 50 different countries, something like 500 to 1000 individuals in each country, so as you can imagine this was a very large data collection effort that was really about breadth&mdash;getting coverage&mdash;as opposed to depth. So we don&rsquo;t really have the data to dig into what are the specific enablers of car pride, what are the different parts that go into its formation, for example. That&rsquo;s not really captured in our survey. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the U.S., we&rsquo;ve done some more in-depth surveys in a couple of cities and what we&rsquo;ve found is that the highest car pride among any individuals in our sample are in two different groups. Here it&rsquo;s the lower-income individuals who don&rsquo;t yet own a car. And so I see all of these households or individuals owning cars around me, and I aspire to achieve that symbol of success or social status. It&rsquo;s about wanting something that I don&rsquo;t yet have and aspiring to it. I think that&rsquo;s a huge part of this social comparative, aspirational part of pride, particularly in developing countries where car ownership is something that is really tied to higher-income, higher-education individuals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then the other group that had very high car pride in the U.S. were very high-income luxury car owners. And so they differentiate themselves from the general middle-class, run-of-the-mill car owner by the type of vehicle that they drive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this again is very different in developing countries where you don&rsquo;t have 91% of households owning a car, which is what the number is now in the United States. But I do think that luxury brands continue to play a role. I know we&rsquo;ve talked, to some extent, that in the U.A.E many of the cars that are owned are these luxury brands and that really reinforces the differentiation between those that don&rsquo;t own a car and those that do. Right? &nbsp;it&rsquo;s that I own a fancy car that really shows my social status, shows my success, my wealth to those around me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Great. Thank you, Joanna. So, did you also look at the sociodemographic differences and perhaps the impact of that on people&rsquo;s car pride? Maybe gender, household number, age, and so on. It would be great if you could talk about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yeah, so in our international survey, as I said, I controlled for some of these individual characteristics and, sort of, partialed that out. And so for the country-level, we&rsquo;ve already controlled for the fact that, potentially, there are differences in household size between the U.S. and respondents from MENA countries. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now if we look at the individual car pride scores&mdash;because we have those in addition to the country scores&mdash;then we can start to explore what are some of the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents that would help to predict whether or not they have higher car pride. those who have higher income tend to have higher car pride. Potentially because they have greater purchasing power, they have the ability to either own a car when others don&rsquo;t or own a nicer car than those of a lower income. We do find that more urban residents have higher car pride in general across different countries. more urban tends to be correlated with income, but I think there&rsquo;s also this aspect of, if you live in a slightly denser area, there are more people around you. So when you talk about this social comparative aspect of pride, there is actually more of a chance to demonstrate it when you live in an urban area. And then we find that males tend to have higher car pride than females. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with age, we see some interesting findings. in the US at least, there&rsquo;s been this hope that Millennials or younger generations will just not have the same level of car culture as older generations and that might lead to lower car ownership and car use. But really. what is emerging here is that that is not at all the case. That there is fairly strong car pride among younger individuals in our sample, both in the U.S. and across countries. car culture is not something that is just inherently decreasing with younger generations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM: </span><span class="c1">But actually what we are finding is that there is a gap between Millennials and previous generations in terms of vehicle licensing, in terms of vehicle ownership and vehicle use&mdash;but that gap can be almost completely explained by the sociodemographic differences between the situation of Millennials and previous generations. And so as Millennials age, their behavior is converging to be very similar to that of previous generations. And so what this really means is that, at least in the U.S., the differences that do exist between car use and car ownership of Millennials&mdash;which are lower now than previous generations&mdash;can just be explained by the fact that Millennials are marrying later; they are stable in their jobs much later than previous generations; they happen to be living a little bit more urban (and that&rsquo;s a piece that may continue). But as they get older, they get married, they start to have kids, they&rsquo;re more settled in their jobs, we are seeing that their behavior looks very, very similar to previous generations at a similar age or, sort of, state in their life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m trying to understand who has the greatest impact or responsibility in forcing this car pride? Do you think it&rsquo;s constructed? What is the role of governments and vehicle manufacturers in this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM: </span><span class="c1">So, that&rsquo;s a really great question. And, I think, this goes back to, first, just the social psychology research on pride. Pride is not what they would call a &ldquo;primary emotion.&rdquo; It is not something that as a baby, you are born and immediately sort of know. You know the emotion of joy or pleasure; you don&rsquo;t know the emotion of pride. Pride is a socialized emotion. So it something that is created through interactions with other individuals and is, sort of, set by social norms. And what that means is that it is constructed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Car pride is constructed. And it is heavily constructed by the advertising of car manufacturers. The car industry is one of the leading global industries in terms of expenditure on marketing. They spend a significant amount of money for each car sold on the imaging around that car. Trying to get that car to appeal to individuals and their sense of self. And these are targeted, right? So it&rsquo;s not just about cars as a symbol of wealth&mdash;although that is a very common selling tactic in, particularly, developing markets&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also about this particular car. If it is a smaller SUV that&rsquo;s meant for city driving, you see it in commercials with the soccer mom who is picking up her kids and friends: it&rsquo;s a symbol of the family. Or you see the pickup truck and its power doing heavy lifting on a farm and that&rsquo;s a symbol of rugged manhood. They do target specific markets with this messaging and it is about connecting it to that person&rsquo;s personal image; it is about creating a symbolic attachment between that individual and who they think they are and that vehicle. And so this is something that is absolutely constructed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I would say that there are some countries where the public sector messaging only reinforces this. We&rsquo;ve had a conversation a little bit about the policy in the UAE around luxury car brands and I think that it really does go into, feed into the fact that the UAE is so high on our survey in terms of its car pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Yeah. That&rsquo;s a very interesting point, Joanna. So, I would like to link that to the topic of new energy vehicles. Do you think there is or will be a correlation between people&rsquo;s car pride and the adoption rates of electric vehicles or perhaps new energy vehicles, in general?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM: </span><span class="c1">So, I haven&rsquo;t looked specifically at the relationship between car pride and electric vehicle [or EV] ownership, but there have been a number of studies that have really looked at what are the symbolic values or attitudes that individuals have and how does that correlated with EV adoption. And there&rsquo;s one particularly strong study that has shown that, it&rsquo;s as much about a sense of innovation and, sort of, tech-savviness and being on the forefront of technology as it is about environmental concerns. And so, while EVs are greener, for a lot of the adopters of electric vehicles, it&rsquo;s also about the fact that an EV is a new, impressive gadget; it&rsquo;s the forefront of vehicle technology. They&rsquo;re seen as, sort of, a leader in terms of the social innovation. And so again it&rsquo;s about what does this say about me in comparison to the general car owner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think that that, again, has been tapped into particularly with Tesla&rsquo;s models. They have really sold themselves as a luxury car brand, that happens to be electric, but really speaks to: &ldquo;we are a start-up car manufacturer; we are really high-tech&rdquo; And that piece of their image has really resonated with these early adopters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t agree more. So that takes me to another question. Do you think we might soon see something like &ldquo;bus pride&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;public transit pride? And what needs to happen for us in order to see that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">JM: Yeah. I really want to see this happen. And I think it&rsquo;s something that the public sector, who is often the operator of public transit agencies, have traditionally, sort of, seen their role for information provision to customers to just be </span><span class="c4">neutral</span><span class="c1">. Right? They&rsquo;ve said: &ldquo;We will give information on schedules, we will give you information on where the bus is.&rdquo; But they don&rsquo;t see their role as, sort of, shaping behavior or building attitudes or a brand. There are a couple of exceptions to this and I can get into one or two examples a little bit later on, but one of the things that I like to stress is that there is no such thing in this market as neutral information. The way that you present your transportation options influences people&rsquo;s behavior, even if you are not trying to. And so the fact that they are not marketing their services; that they are not creating a brand; that they are not connecting to what it is about their service that individuals might enjoy, means that they are losing a marketing war with car manufacturers by not engaging at all. And so there is no neutral position. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, given that, how do we create a brand around public transit to get the people who are riding public transit excited about riding public transit. First, it is really hard to sell a product that is very poor. And so, at some point, we do need to be investing in better public transit infrastructure and better public transit service. So it&rsquo;s not just about branding; it&rsquo;s also about increasing the frequency, providing better bus service, providing better rail service. But as we make those investments in public transit, we should also be making the complementary investments in building a brand for these public transit systems. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are a couple of things about public transit that could really speak to people. One is the fact that some of these technologies are very high tech. Let&rsquo;s talk about trains that have communication-based signaling systems that can run fairly autonomously. Let&rsquo;s talk about the shared mobility aspects of this [public transit] and the social aspects of this. Where this is a shared space and you actually get to interact with different people. That&rsquo;s a real opportunity if you sell it that way. And then let&rsquo;s talk about the environmental aspects of this. And, for example, there are a number of electric buses, hydrogen buses, that are on the market today. In the U.S., you can go to some of the areas that have these buses in operation and there is almost, you can&rsquo;t tell that this isn&rsquo;t a regular diesel bus. I would love to see that bus be all green or other things to differentiate itself from the typical bus and, sort of, say&mdash;by riding this bus, you are making a particularly important impact on the environment. Now actually, all buses are green to some extent because they are a more efficient way of moving individuals, and so in general your carbon footprint taking a bus or train is much lower than taking a car. But if we want to tap into, again, that differentiator. It&rsquo;s about, you know, can we sell some of these new energy vehicles, like you would an electric vehicle about social innovation; can we do that same thing in the public transit realm. And so I think that there is absolutely space for building that brand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mentioned examples, so I want to give one. And this is the case of London. if you actually go back to around the 1970s riding public transit meant that you had failed in some way in your life attainment. Nowadays, the red double decker bus of London is a symbol of the city. The Mayor of London, when they have their first day in office, almost always has a photo opportunity of them taking the bus to the office. The double decker bus was sent to Beijing to receive the Olympic torch on behalf of London when they were going to be the host of the next Olympic games. Right? This is how tied public transit is to, sort of, the symbol of being a Londoner and the symbol of the city. And that was done through years of building up this brand for public transit. And it was accompanying the investments they made on the ground in terms of their transportation system. So things like, putting in a congestion charge in the center of the city and using that revenue to improve the bus network. But they also invested in the symbolism around those buses. They tied, again, those bus investments to symbols of the future of the city, the future of mobility, in a way that really created a brand for them. And so it&rsquo;s about investment in the system itself, but also complementing that and leveraging those changes to really build new connections with potential riders and existing riders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AS: I absolutely agree. That&rsquo;s inspiring. And I hope we see more examples like the London bus everywhere soon. So my next question is about COVID-19, of course. And the question is: do you think COVID-19 did or will have an impact on people&rsquo;s mobility behavior in the short- and long-terms? And do you expect that to have an impact on people&rsquo;s decision to own or purchase a car? And also on their car pride?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">JM: the COVID-19 pandemic has absolutely changed people&rsquo;s behavior and will have long-term impacts. One of the things that it is important to remember is that ownership of a car is a long-term decision; it&rsquo;s not like choosing to take a car for a single trip. Once you own a car, you use it more often. And so trying to get people to change their view of car culture before they ever own a car is really one of the best ways to break the reinforcing cycle of car ownership, car pride, and car use. Now, COVID has absolutely, sort of, been a touch point in this cycle, and I think in the wrong direction. Which is that during the pandemic, there are real reasons to be concerned about viral transmission on public transit and so people feel safer in private cars. We&rsquo;ve seen survey after survey that are starting to say, that even if car sales are down globally, interest in purchasing a car as soon as people are able to, has grown. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do I think that COVID has impacted car pride, specifically? I would say that, probably in the way that we have defined and measured car pride that it is unlikely to have been affected too much by COVID. But I think the broader value of the car has absolutely been impacted by COVID. We actually have a study in the U.S. that we just completed that shows that, sort of, the value that people place on the car has increased about three fold during COVID compared to previously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS: </span><span class="c1">Great. So I would like to conclude this exciting episode with advice. So, Joanna, if you were to give advice to the following stakeholder, what would it be? So 1) government officials or policymakers, 2) vehicle manufacturers, and 3) individuals or consumers. What would be your advice to each one of these stakeholders?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">JM:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Advice to consumers. I would say that the car that you buy now will be impacting the environment for many, many years to come. Cars spend around 15 years in the global car fleet, even if you are not owning it for that full time. And so, the more environmentally-friendly car that you can buy now that still meets your needs, the better. If you can avoid car ownership because you live in an urban area, there are ample options like public transit, walking, biking, but also now complementary services like ridehailing so if you need a car trip now and then, you can get it without owning your own car. Now, not everyone lives in an urban area where that is available to them, and then I would urge you to consider either an electric vehicle or, if an electric vehicle doesn&rsquo;t meet your needs, to buy a smaller car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The larger your vehicle, the much, much greater the impact on the environment. And I will caution that, if you are a U.S. consumer, we use miles per gallon (MPG) as the main, sort of, fuel efficiency measure of cars. Now miles per gallon is not a linear measure, and what I mean by that is that the difference between 5 MPG and 10 MPG is not actually the same thing as the difference between 25 MPG and 30 MPG. So what that means is, if you are at the lower end of MPG&mdash;so if you are driving an SUV that only gets 15 MPG&mdash;downsizing that vehicle a little and going to something that gets 20 or 25 MPG makes a huge impact. So, really consider the size of your vehicle. Cause smaller vehicles are already much more fuel efficient, and so right-sizing really what you need is going to be important here. That is what I would say for consumers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, for vehicle manufacturers: to produce smaller vehicles (although I know that their profit margins are highest on the large vehicles that they sell). So that&rsquo;s going to be a hard one to convince them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For policymakers, they are going to be the ones who are really going to influence how OEMs [original equipment manufacturers, or automakers] evolve and what options that they have on the table. And so continuing to enforce fuel efficiency standards and even continue to make the targets stricter as we go forward, will mean that OEMs will need to be selling more vehicles that are higher in fuel efficiency, whether those are electric or smaller, more fuel-efficient internal combustion engine vehicles. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then I would also say, if you are in an urban area: invest in public transit. COVID has impacted ridership and there is this sense that, you know, maybe this is the end of public transit. Public transit is absolutely critical for any sort of economic recovery from COVID. It is the backbone of the mobility systems for cities. if you want your city to recover, you need to be investing in public transit. And that does not just mean maintaining services at pre-pandemic levels; this means using this as an opportunity for expanding services, for branding those services, for connecting those services to people who continue to ride and rely on these services during the pandemic, but also to potentially new riders who are currently working at home. And what does that branding look like for a post-COVID world I think that that is something that the public sector is going to need to think through, but they need to be having those conversations now and really be thinking about PT as one of the keys to the future of urban mobility and just, sort of, sustainable transportation in general going forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AS:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thank you very much, Joanna.
