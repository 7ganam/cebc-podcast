Episode 3.</span><span class="c11"><br><br>Transcript</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>Dana Darwish (DD):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Welcome to the Second Season of CEBC MENA Podcast, the Future Mobility Season, that covers various topics that support the transition towards sustainable, equitable, and resilient mobility system. My name is Dana Darwish, your CEBC MENA host.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For today&#39;s episode, we will plunge into the topic of alternative fuels and powertrains, for a comparative assessment between the USA and MENA. The episode will predominantly focus on advanced vehicle technologies, to observe the different regional perceptions and opportunities, regional barriers for adoption, their relation to better environmental impact and emission reductions, and roles of private and public stakeholders to promote these alternatives and sustainable technologies.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD: </span><span class="c1">We are very pleased to have two experts with extensive knowledge and experience for today&#39;s topic, Dr. Rubal Dua, Research Fellow at King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) and Randall Field, Executive Director of the Mobility Systems Center at the MIT Energy Initiative. Not to let you all wait any longer, let us begin this interesting discussion.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There is a wide range of vehicle alternatives: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, hybrid, plug-in-hybrid, electric, biofuel powered, hydrogen and even solar. And while some of these are commercially available globally, the adoption preference varies from one place or one region to another and from one specific society to another.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"><br></span><span class="c0">DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rubal, can you please walk us through this work you do at KAPSARC within this area? What&#39;s currently happening in MENA in that space? Which technologies are currently available and which technology would you say is or would and should be the regional mainstream from both environmental and economical points of view?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>Rubal Dua (RD):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thank you, Dana, and thank you CEBC for this opportunity to participate in this podcast. I am really excited about it. About me and the work we do at KAPSARC. Just a little bit about KAPSARC first. KAPSARC is a research center located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We focus on energy economics and energy policy issues. In particular, my research at KAPSARC focuses on the policy issues pertaining to the light-duty vehicle sector. So we look at various supply and demand side policies for promoting energy efficiency within the light-duty vehicle sector.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In terms of the various technologies that are currently available within Saudi Arabia and the MENA region, they are mainly dominated by the traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The hybrid technology was introduced a few years ago in Saudi Arabia and in Dubai (and the UAE broadly speaking). Even electric vehicles both plug-in-hybrid and pure battery electric vehicles have already been introduced. Saudi Arabia is currently preparing the standards to allow for easier import of plug-in electric vehicles as well as the standards for establishing the charging infrastructure within the kingdom.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now we have, that&#39;s interesting, mean, that perspective. Let&#39;s fly to the USA. Randall, How&#39;s it going at your end? How is that space there? Please tell us about the work you do at the Mobility Systems Center and the MIT Energy Initiative working with these alternative fuels and new energy vehicles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>Randy Field (RF):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;At the MIT Energy Initiative, our research is focused on: how do we go about supplying energy to the world, given the world&#39;s growing demand for energy over the decades ahead and do so with a lower carbon footprint. So the work that we&#39;re doing at the Mobility System Center is directly related to that. How do we provide a growing demand for mobility throughout the world and do so with a reduced CO2 footprint? In this research, we look at alternative powertrains and alternative fuels.<br></span><span class="c7"><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;When it comes to light-duty vehicles, electrification is, of course, one of the important paths forward. There are of course hybridization, plug-in hybrids and fully electric, battery electric vehicles. Each of these has a role to play in decreasing the carbon footprint of transportation. We look at all different aspects of that, not only the life cycle emissions, including the supply of the energy, but also the questions of, how do people make decisions about vehicle purchase and the role of government policy. Because, as you mentioned, throughout the world different countries have different interests in these different alternative fuels and vehicles, and a lot of that has to do with government policies because the policy perspective is absolutely essential in the kick start of some of these new technologies.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">Randall, how do you see the impact of these new technologies&mdash;specifically in the battery technology, where cost has been declining over the past few years and the [production] capacity has been increasing&mdash;on the sales of new energy vehicles and the adoptions rates?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;First of all, these technologies have come a long way. If you look over the past 10 years, things have changed tremendously in this regard. So looking at electric vehicles, first of all, the cost of these vehicles has dropped precipitously over the last 10 years. And the driving force there is, of course, the battery technology. Ten years ago, the cost of batteries was well over one thousand dollars per kilowatt-hour, and today, the price of these batteries is approaching $100 per kilowatt-hour. So that has been a huge driver in the change in adoption and affordability of these [cars]; however, a battery electric vehicle still costs more than an internal combustion engine vehicle of the same characteristics.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So that&#39;s one barrier, but really the biggest barrier to adoption is what we referred to as range anxiety and charging availability. Range anxiety is the fact that a battery electric vehicle does not have the range of a typical gasoline powered vehicle. Things have improved tremendously and the range of many models of battery electric vehicles is now over 300 kilometers, which is great, but not as good as an internal combustion vehicle.</span><span class="c7"><br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But the other fact is that people in different parts of the world have different levels of access to a parking spot, and for that matter, to the ability to charge when they go home at night. So if you look at city dwellers, the ability to charge at night depends on where you park your car and how you park your car. It is a very different situation for city dwellers, living in multi-unit dwellings versus a suburban dweller, who has a driveway and maybe a garage and easy access to charging overnight. So that has a tremendous impact on people&#39;s adoption rate in these two situations.<br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you happen to be at a household in the suburbs, with two cars and one of those cars could be electric and, the issue of range anxiety doesn&#39;t get in the way. But if you&#39;re an urban dweller and you don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to charge, that could be an issue. So what we find is that people who already own a battery electric vehicle become comfortable with the situation quickly, but people who don&#39;t have the experience are less so.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">What do you think, Rubal, about this? How do you see the impact of these new technologies on the adoption rates in the MENA region?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RD</span><span class="c1">: I think you framed it very appropriately. A lot of it is about perception. It may or may not actually be true. But, if things are perceived differently by customers, then it affects adoption a lot. <br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">So comparing hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles versus pure battery electric vehicles. There are a few plus points and minus points for both. For battery electric vehicles, you know, the charging infrastructure can, in principle, be easily deployed because it&#39;s all electricity based; whereas for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, you need the refueling infrastructure, which can be an issue especially considering hydrogen.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The plus point for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles is the range and their refueling time; so they can drive a lot further compared to a battery electric vehicle. And they can be refueled a lot quickly, almost in five minutes, like a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. Whereas, battery electric vehicles, even with fast charging, takes about 30 minutes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"><br></span><span class="c0">RD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But then, at the end of the day, consumers are more often than not technology agnostic, they are technology neutral. They don&#39;t care so much about the powertrain as such; what they care about is performance, what they care about is safety, reliability, and sometimes operating costs.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RD: </span><span class="c1">And, in that sense, it takes time, especially for reliability to be established. It does take time for consumers to become comfortable with a sudden technology, especially the safety and reliability aspects of it.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And at the top of it is usually the price concerns, both the upfront price as well as the operating costs. So, both a battery electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles have a higher upfront cost at this point of time, compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.&nbsp;The advantage with battery electric vehicles is that the operating cost is a lot lower, because electricity is cheap, is relatively cheaper compared to gasoline and diesel fuels. For hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle, it&#39;s still not an advantage yet, despite, you know, high fuel economy of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, because the hydrogen fuel is still costly.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">So in the coming few years things will evolve, cost will most likely go down with economies of scale on the manufacturing side, as well as through learning by doing. And same goes for the fuels. It is expected that the hydrogen fuel costs would go down and with it the operating costs for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. Within the MENA region, there is this peculiar case that because we have warmer climates, we have higher temperatures and batteries are known to degrade faster at higher temperatures. So there&#39;s this one limitation with battery electric vehicles especially for the MENA region, but it&#39;s not something that cannot be addressed through appropriate technological interventions, perhaps through cooling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And so, you know, technology, technological problems, can usually be addressed. It&#39;s the economics part of it that takes a bit of time. Moreover, the getting the consumers comfortable with the reliability as well as safety aspects that usually takes time.<br><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">What do you think are the most important factors affecting the adoption rates of these new energy vehicle and especially the battery electric vehicles, Randall?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RF</span><span class="c1 c4">: In terms of the adoption rate and uptake, there&#39;s a whole learning process out there for consumers in making these decisions. And, fortunately, it is a virtuous circle where as more people have these electric vehicles and there&#39;s more exposure&mdash;and maybe the Uber and Lyft drivers have electric vehicles and you get more and more exposure to these alternative fuel vehicles&mdash;people learn. They hear about the merits, and they experience some of the characteristics of these cars&mdash;which have some good acceleration and have quietness and so forth&mdash;and they get the exposure and see how it&#39;s charged and so forth. Then, that becomes an acceleration of the adoption of these things, but, of course, you have to have that build out of the recharging infrastructure or fueling infrastructure to make that circle work. So it&#39;s really that cycle of adoption. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">When it comes to, you know, sort of the smaller vehicles, whether it&#39;s a scooter or other thing [small vehicle], it&#39;s a bit easier to electrify. Whereas if it&#39;s a heavy-duty, longer-range [vehicle], then it&#39;s more difficult to electrify. <br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1">Also we can&#39;t lose sight of the beauty of hybridization, because hybridization itself gives you a great deal of efficiency. Keep in mind that, at the moment, there are parts of the world where it&#39;s more environmentally friendly in terms of CO2, to have a hybrid vehicle versus a battery electric vehicle. If the local electricity is being made by burning coal, for example, you&#39;re better off with a hybrid vehicle. And that, of course, will change, though. As you look at the life of any vehicle&mdash;you know, [the life of] a light-duty vehicles is typically 14 years, and the life of a truck, it can be even longer&mdash;over the life of that vehicle the electricity supply will decarbonize through a number of actions that are going on throughout the world at this time.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As you go to [consider] heavier duty vehicles, then you have alternatives, such as hydrogen fueling, which gives you some great options. And the trick there is, again, the chicken and egg. If you&#39;re going to have a fleet of trucks that are going to be powered by hydrogen, somebody&#39;s got to take the initiative to build out the infrastructure or enough fueling stations to allow the trucking fleet to build out [operate]. So it&#39;s a very tricky chicken and egg problem because you&#39;ve got the OEMs who have to build the vehicles, somebody has got to buy and run the vehicles, and somebody else has got to have the infrastructure for refueling those hydrogen vehicles. So it is a complex thing that really needs to involve government agencies, as well as the OEM&#39;s and the trucking fleet owners all working together to agree upon a plan.</span><span class="c2"><br><br></span><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">Rubal, what do you think are the most important technological innovations that OEMs need to focus on to accelerate adoption and meet the customers&rsquo; expectations?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sure, so, when it comes to technological innovation, a big component of that is how much of it has passed on to the consumer in terms of things that they care about. So, one thing that is very much in favor of electric vehicles, is their high performance or high acceleration: you know, 0 to 60 and in less than 2 seconds. And a lot of consumers, especially younger consumers, care a lot about high performance. You know, that thrill that you can get from accelerating so fast. So they don&#39;t, the automakers don&#39;t need to worry too much about passing on improvements in technology for improving the acceleration. It&#39;s already a big plus for battery electric vehicles. What they do need to pass on are reductions in upfront price, as well as the improvements in the perception of safety and reliability.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">So, when it comes to upfront price, it just so happens that until now, while the costs of batteries have declined precipitously, have declined a lot over the last 10 years. Those have not translated into upfront price reduction. This is because automakers are transferring those price reductions to increasing the size of the battery to increase the driving range. So, for example, if you look at the price of Nissan Leaf in the US, it has actually not fallen over the last 10 years. And it&#39;s mainly because most of the price reductions have been translated into putting bigger size batteries in the vehicle to improve its driving range.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">Hopefully in the near future, once the new battery chemistries come on the market and once, through economies of scale and learning by doing, the battery price cost reductions can be translated into upfront price reductions for the vehicle, because that is what the consumers care about, especially the cost-conscious consumers. And the other part of technology innovation that needs to happen is the increase in the driving range.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">Going back to the question from the point of view of the automaker selling all these alternative fuel vehicles. And a lot of it, you know, comes down to profitability. For a private manufacturer, a private player, it all boils down to, the bottom line is profitability. And it just so happens that at this point of time, internal combustion engine vehicles are more profitable compared to plug-in electric vehicles. So, without any policy push automakers would, you know like any private player or investor, would want to maximize their profitability and sell the vehicles that ensure higher profitability. For plug in electric vehicles, the profit margins still may not be that high, especially because the cost of the battery is still high.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">So, without any, absent any policy push automakers are not likely to give signals to their sales teams to encourage consumers to adopt plug-in electric vehicles. So there is a need, at least in the current times, for policy levers to be put in place as well to level the playing field, so to speak.<br><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">Thank you Rubal. So from my understanding, I see that there are barriers present in both the USA and MENA, common and different ones as well. Because, for all the enthusiasm for alternative vehicles and the news that we have noticed, actual progress in the market is still taking some time to emerge.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;What can be done here, policy wise and implementation wise, to tackle these challenges? Maybe we can start with you, Randy. What can be done here? What policy levers might need to be put in place in the USA?<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;In the United States, there are a number of policy levers that come into play. It&#39;s been apparent from some past experience that we have both federal and state level policies that support the adoption of battery electric vehicles, for example, as well as hydrogen vehicles out in California. And there&#39;s been plenty of evidence that shows, if you take away those policies, you actually can see a drop in sales of those vehicles. And so, these types of incentives, most of them are focused on how do you reduce the purchase cost (the effect of net purchase cost) to the buyer. In the United States, there is a federal policy where you basically get a tax credit on a purchase of a battery electric vehicle or a plug-in-hybrid vehicle. Likewise, some states have further support for that [the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles]. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">In addition to that, going to the OEM side, there&#39;s also what we call CAFE standards in the United States, which says that the OEM has to achieve a certain level of average fuel efficiency / fuel economy of their vehicles across everything that they sell. And what that type of policy does is it forces them to have a mix of vehicles, some of them which are below that standard and some that are above that standard. By having electric vehicles in the fleet that substantially helps them hit those particular targets. What it comes down to is that the OEM has to either manufacture and sell enough of these high efficiency vehicles and battery vehicles to hit its [average fuel economy] target. Or if they don&#39;t, they have to then buy credits from a company that, like Tesla, that only has battery electric vehicles and has an excess of credits. So, basically, these OEMs have to make a decision on, okay are they going to be in the electric vehicle business in the future and how do they get there. And they can afford, to some extent, to subsidize the sale of those battery electric vehicles into the market, because either they cross subsidize within their own manufactured fleet or they&#39;re going to have to basically subsidize Tesla [by buying Tesla credits]. And so, it seems clear that you&#39;re better off in the long-term subsidizing your own build-out of battery electric vehicle technology versus subsidizing Tesla, if that&#39;s your competition.</span><span class="c2"><br><br></span><span class="c0">DD:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Randall, how do you see the effect of the Biden-Harris administration on the EV landscape in the USA? Do you think we will see policies that will enable the transition to EVs soon?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1">The Biden-Harris Administration is definitely moving to policies that will further accelerate the adoption of battery electric vehicle technologies and this is on multiple fronts. They&#39;re expected to strengthen the CAFE standards, but also their decision to, their commitment to electrify the federal fleet is very important, because in doing so, you&#39;re driving up the production volumes, and by driving up production volumes, you&#39;re effectively reducing the cost per unit&mdash;and that helps reduce the cost for everybody.&nbsp;Also, by putting out a larger fleet of electric vehicles, it creates a better and bigger infrastructure network effect for electric vehicle charging. In addition, the administration is planning to help further build out that recharging infrastructure. So, there are many cylinders on which the Biden-Harris administration is pushing to further accelerate this electrification drive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>DD: </span><span class="c1">Yeah, exactly. So, how is it MENA, Rubal? How is the enable an enabling environment there? Are we falling behind in comparison to USA and what more needs to be done?<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">So, in terms of policies, Saudi Arabia, based on my understanding, is leading the efforts in the policy landscape through the supply-side policy called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, which are very similar to the US CAFE standards, which Randy was just talking about.&nbsp;And through that policy, the Saudi Energy Efficiency Center (SEEC) has setup targets for automakers to meet on an annual basis to improve the new vehicle fleet fuel economy. And those targets are technology neutral. But the rate at which they have been set, which is around a 3-4% annual improvement, it does encourage automakers to sell more fuel efficient vehicles or higher fuel economy vehicles.&nbsp;And given that the targets keep increasing annually, at some point, it makes a lot more sense for the automakers to start selling plug-in electric vehicles because they have much higher fuel economy compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. So it&#39;s a technology neutral policy that Saudi Arabia implemented starting from 2016 onwards. And we have standards set out until 2023.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">Apart from this supply-side policy other policies, especially demand-side policies, have been in place in most of the other economies such as US, China, even India. But they haven&#39;t been picked up so much in the in the MENA region. And [this is] primarily because, although these are demand side policies&mdash;in particular you set up incentives for consumers to purchase these plug in electric vehicles; you offer them upfront incentives in the form of either rebates or income tax credits like Randy was mentioning&mdash;but at the end of the day the automaker usually adjusts its prices, so as to be able to recover their investments.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, for example, if the incentive in the US is roughly around $7500&mdash;the Federal incentive&mdash;and State incentives of around $2,500, more often than not, you&#39;ll see that the automakers set prices which are an additional $10,000 compared to a similar size internal combustion engine vehicle.&nbsp;And because they are, they are recovering their investment on it and as soon as these incentives are taken away, for example it happened for the case of Tesla. Because US has this cap, that, once the 200,000-th vehicle is sold by the manufacturer, they will not get any more, no consumer buying a vehicle from the manufacturer will get any income tax credit.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c4">So as soon as the 200,000-th mark was hit for Tesla, and there were some phase out months, Tesla started offering $3000, $4000, $5000 reductions in its prices. And so it&#39;s sensible that, you know, the automakers would keep the prices higher when they see subsidies or incentives being offered by the government.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And while these are demand side policies to encourage consumers to adopt, at the same time, these are also, they also contribute to, in one sense, help the countries meet their industrial targets.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">These are also industrial policy in one sense. And because in MENA region there is no manufacturing of plug-in electric vehicles that takes place. So in one sense, you know, this if they offer incentives, it will more often than not go into the pockets of these automakers, which are all outside the MENA region. So, for that, maybe for that reason, I&#39;m not a policy maker, of course, we haven&#39;t seen much demand side incentives being offered. And perhaps it might be tricky for them to incentivize adoption through these demand side incentives until local manufacturing starts in the MENA region.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>DD</span><span class="c1">: So, we&#39;ve touched upon policy at the moment, but let&#39;s move to the life cycle of those vehicles, specifically, the life cycle emissions of those different new energy vehicles in both regions, Are there any estimations at the moment? Are those really considered to be green vehicles? And if so, how green are they? I believe this is a bit controversial and debatable as it all depends on where the electricity is coming from. So give us a little bit of an insight on that. <br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1">Within the United States, the level of carbon emissions regarding electricity supply is very different from location to location. So in all parts of the United States, driving an electric vehicle is less carbon intensive than driving a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle. But in some parts of the United States today, you&#39;re better off driving a hybrid gasoline powered vehicle, than driving a battery electric vehicle because in a particular region of the country, the electricity is made predominantly from coal. As you look at electricity supply, you have to recognize some electricity is made using coal, some is made using natural gas, hydro, solar, wind, nuclear&mdash;and each of these has a different CO2 footprint.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now, keep in mind that even if today you&#39;re driving a [battery electric] vehicle, and you&#39;re using electricity that&#39;s somewhat carbon intensive, as I said, you&#39;re better off than driving a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle. And over the life of that vehicle (14 years or more), the electricity supply will be further decarbonized, because certainly the United States and many other parts of the world are moving quite aggressively to decarbonize the electricity supply.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c1 c4">Keep in mind that of the entire economy, electricity is actually the easiest part of the economy to decarbonize. And so that&#39;s one of the fastest moving segments to decarbonize. As you decide to build out and deploy electric vehicles (or other vehicles, hydrogen and so forth), you have to keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not a static situation. the electricity supply will become greener over time and since the asset you&rsquo;re buying, the car, is going to last 14 or more years, you have to recognize that the environmental benefit will continue to improve over time.<br><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I kind of agree both with Dana and with Randy. Yeah, it used to be debatable whether these vehicles are green or not. But like Randy was saying, going forward, you know, these vehicles when they are bought, they stay on the road for 14 to 15 years and most countries have plans to clean up the electricity grid as well. So, it&#39;s perhaps not going to be as debatable going forward as it used to be in the past.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Because most countries have policies in place to clean up the electricity grid. Like Randy said, is a lot easier to clean, compared to actually the transport sector.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">So, going forward, the CO2 reductions promised by vehicle electrification are perhaps going to start being realized. That being said, the manufacturing component of it is perhaps something which might be difficult to clean up as quickly as it will be to clean up the electricity used to drive the car.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">But, again, even on the manufacturing side, you know, based on what I understand, 50% of the CO2 emissions involved in the manufacturing [of alternative fuel vehicles], come from the energy used which, more often than not, is electricity.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">And again, so there is good scope for improving or reducing the CO2 emissions from the manufacturing side as well.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RD: </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And even the MENA region is quite a lot at the forefront of cleaning up our electricity grids. So, you know, it is almost at par with the US and other major economies of the world, when it comes to the renewable energy investments. And so, even in the MENA region, it will not be a surprise that the CO2 emissions&mdash;the combined overall life cycle emissions, at least the upstream and the vehicle use emissions&mdash;will go down for plug-in electric vehicles and be favorably comparable to internal combustion engine vehicles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"><br></span><span class="c0">DD: </span><span class="c1">Thank you so much for both of you for answering those questions in a very detailed and informative way.
