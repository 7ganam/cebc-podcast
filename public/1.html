        >For today&rsquo;s episode, the second episode of the season, we will be
        embarking on the topic of Covid-19 and public transportation and/or
        shared mobility, for a quick comparative assessment between the MENA and
        the USA, so we will be scrutinizing the interrelations between public
        transportation and Covid-19 by tackling four subtopics: public
        perception, impact of Covid-19, role of technological innovation,
        lessons learned and policy applications of the Covid-19 crisis on public
        transport. We are joined today with Dr Ayman Smadi, MENA Director of the
        International Association of Public Transport UITP and Professor Jinhua
        Zhao, Associate Professor of City and Transportation Planning at MIT and
        Director of MIT Mobility Initiative.

    <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c8 c3 c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c3 c5">Alright, let&rsquo;s begin. </span></p>

      <span class="c2">DD: I</span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >n general people all over the world have different attitudes towards
        public transport. Some support it and can&#39;t go a day without using
        it and some dreaded and might have never used it. Now, we all know there
        are a lot of factors that play a role here, such as the current
        infrastructure, incentives, travelling habits and services... But,
        I&#39;m just so very curious to see how different the perceptions are
        and the attitudes are before Covid-19, before the Covid-19 era in the
        USA and MENA. So, I am guessing the views in the MENA region is quite
        variable from one country to another if I am not mistaken, Aman. So,
        could you tell us more about that?

      <span class="c2">Ayman Smadi (AS): </span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >Thank you very much Dana. Indeed, the views are quite varied across the
        region especially where topics of transport is quite prominent and is
        used by a lot of segments of the population.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c8 c3 c5"></span></p>

    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >I also would like to qualify this perception if you allow me because in
        many cases the perception depends on the kinds of services that are
        available for the users. So, in many cases we have a negative perception
        of public transport in the region simply because public transport
        services do not necessarily live up to an acceptable standard for the
        user.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c8 c3 c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c12">02:55 &ndash; 04:16</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >In some other cases, you know countries with I guess higher GDP per
        capita with a lot of car ownership; then the question is a bit different
        in terms of the convenience, you know the time advantage, etc. for using
        public transportation. But certainly, I think this has been a
        long-standing argument within the MENA region, that people in the region
        don&rsquo;t necessarily feel strongly about the public transportation.
        However, if I look across the region, I start from the West from Morocco
        to you know Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and make it all the way to
        the GCC, the Gulf Cooperation Council; we see that a large segment of
        the population actually depends on public transportation. We also see
        that this perception has changed maybe you know for the last thirty
        years, so there was quite a bit of dependence on public transportation
        before the growth in car ownership. Then, we saw that decline and you
        know, so increase negativity about public transportation with the ease
        of accessibility of owning a car and unfortunately many of the cities in
        the region had catered for cars and we actually created cities
        unfortunately, that gridlock, they are made for cars. They neglected the
        priority for public transportation or walking or cycling on any other
        mode.</span

    <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c8 c3 c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c12">04:16 &ndash; 05:08</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >So we saw a reversal of this actually as we, you know I would say in
        the last five years especially, because it proved that by building more
        roads, by having lots of cars, you are actually not creating mobility;
        you are creating a lot of problems: environmental impact, economic
        impact, delays, accidents, etc. So, even for me, somebody who has been
        working in the region since 2008, I see this transformation almost like
        a paradigm shift. Where you see a city like Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which
        is a very typical grid, you know, road system, lots of highways and
        roads, almost, you know like the American system, in a way. And they are
        implementing one of the largest and most ambitious public transport
        projects in the world building and metro creating a Bus Rapid Transit
        network as well as a city bus network.

      <span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c5"
        >So, as you said, you know, that I believe the perception has changed.
        There is more awareness, especially among the youth who prefer mobility
        than owning a car, if you will. You know if I&#39;m connected, I have
        access to something that will take me where I need to go. I don&#39;t
        care necessarily about driving a car. I don&#39;t have that as you, but
        I just wanted to start with this.</span

        transit plays a very significant role, but in a large part of the
        country, still it&#39;s [travel] dominated by single occupancy vehicles:
        driving. Right? So the perception is, there&#39;s quite a contrast

        the big metropolitan areas. One is for the urban vibrancy. This is to
        get people into the downtown core to support high density of employment,
        support a good urban agglomeration, therefore, higher productivity. But
        the other role is, it provides a lifeline for many of the low-income

        not have people on metros or buses. So, this is not necessarily you know

        as an opportunity window for changing people&rsquo;s behaviour in the
        following sense: because of Covid we can no longer take many things for
        granted, many of our routines are disrupted. So here in this time,
        that&rsquo;s the best time to introduce changes for people because
        everyone is reevaluating their options anyway, right</span

        confidence in this. And hopefully when the crisis is over and people can
        recover, and more than recover and to try to really be attracted to the
        service. It&rsquo;s a high call, right. I&#39;m not saying, this is

        a lot of more empirical study about that exact transmission risk of the
        virus if people are traveling, in some, like public transit buses to
        train stations. Here we did some preliminary study, all we can say now
        is that there are a lot of things we can do to help reduce this risk:
        mask wearing is critical, ventilation is critical, limit the number, the
        highest number of densities on these vehicles is important.</span

        if the above we do well, going on the public transit pose a higher risk
        than the other occasions, for example, you go into the restaurant and go
        into other gatherings. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.</span

        relatively, compared to different activities that people are conducting
        these days, public transit, we don&#39;t see strong empirical evidence
        to show it has a higher risk that other contexts that people are doing.
        Again, it is not conclusive, we need a lot more study to be done. And
        then with the new variant of this virus, we really don&#39;t have like a
        clear answer to that.</span

        can do a good job, really scale up the vaccination process, when we will
        achieve this herd immunity and public health is no longer the worry...
        That&#39;s the context that I really want to pay attention to.

        disease, is no longer a question given the herd immunity. Would people
        have this residual stigma of public transit being unhealthy or not.
        That&#39;s something we can clearly fight against. Because we know that,
        by that time, it shouldn&#39;t be a risk but if people still believe
        there&#39;s a risk, that means something we didn&#39;t do very well,

        retrospective planning and operation regime to a more proactive and
        predictive operation regime.</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >What do I mean here? Dr. Smadi mentioned the data and the machine
        learning or artificial intelligence really changing the way we look at
        the system. For example, for a long time, we actually don&#39;t know
        what the, the demand pattern looked like in the system.</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1">41:53 &ndash; 42:35</span><span class="c3"><br /></span
      ><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >For example, if you look at the most of the like a sizable city. If I
        want to understand the demand origin to destination matrix. That used to
        be done by manual surveys for example, in London or in New York they
        hire 100 people, they intercept passengers coming out of the station,
        and asked where you come from, where you go to, what time by what mode
        etcetera. If you think about this is a very inefficient way of doing
        things and the demand matrix could be really large and the cost of doing
        this manual survey is exorbitant. So we don&#39;t do that often; we
        often use like, a five-year-old or 10-year-old demand matrix to be the
        foundation of our planning process.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">42:35 &ndash; 42:57</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >But now, we see smart card data, or big data broadly defined, including
        this smart ticket, or transit vehicle location data or RFID [radio
        frequency identification] data or mobile phone data. Now we can get a
        much better understanding of the demand pattern. This is the foundation
        for any of these planning, operation, control, all these activities,
        right? That&#39;s one part.</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1">42:57 &ndash; 43:32 </span><span class="c3"><br /></span
      ><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >The second part is the development of this data analytic capacity,
        including the machine learning that&rsquo;s become more and more
        significant in the past 5, 10 years.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So, now, we&#39;re able to, for example, at MIT, we&#39;re able to
        predict the demand. Both in the short-term horizon, for example, we can
        predict in the next 15 or 30 minutes how many people will come into the
        station and enter. So, if you know this, you can then pre-empt some of
        the problems, right, say for example, station crowd control. This is one
        important trend.</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1">43:32 &ndash; 43:59</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >A second important trend is from a static and mass service,
        non-responsive, service, to a more customized, and demand-responsive
        service.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >That relates to the fact that, public transit, for a long time, that we
        have a fixed schedule, fixed route, and then we don&#39;t change. Only
        like every half a year or something we do a major planning, operational
        change; other than that, we don&#39;t adjust.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">44:00 &ndash; 44:37</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >But the new mobility services, I mentioned before like the scooter,
        bicycle, ride sharing, they adjust on the daily or hourly basis.</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5">When we bring the two together.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >If you really have a well-designed, a multi-modal integrated system,
        you can bring that together, have the public trying to serve the main
        corridor, high demand, high density services while collaborating with
        new mobility services, to provide the flexibility and customization.
        Right, so that is another area that this whole industry is moving into
        that has a lot of potential to be explored</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">44:37 &ndash; 44:48</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >The third area is from more of a static planning to a more experimental
        spirit, right? So, you experience some experimentation there.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">44:48 - 45:00</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >And the last thing is to, again, from the, the isolated modal services,
        to the more integrated mode of services. For that, technology has a lot
        to be said.</span
      ><span class="c8 c3 c11"><br /></span>

    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c1">45:00 - 45:34</span><span class="c3"><br /></span
      ><span class="c2">MC: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So to conclude today&#39;s podcast we want to take a few moments just
        to think about the post-Covid future.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >And if there&#39;s been any silver lining from the pandemic it may be
        that it&#39;s forced all of us to think a little more creatively about
        how we can adjust and still maintain some normalcy in our daily lives.
        And in many respects, this pandemic period has ushered in an era of
        experimentation and innovation on the part of municipalities, figuring
        out ways to make it work for their citizens when it comes to
        mobility.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">45:34 &ndash; 45:49</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">MC: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So this is an opportunity for re-invention. We&#39;ve spoken a little
        bit throughout the podcast about how there are things that we would like
        to keep. But also there are new ideas and an opportunity maybe to
        re-invent things in our legacy systems.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">45:50 &ndash; 46:14</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">MC: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5">So our final question to both guests.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >What are some of the local initiatives through local governments or the
        private sector, or civil society, that have provided people with safer
        mobility modes, such as active mobility. What have people been
        experimenting with? And what&#39;s worth keeping or expanding upon in
        the post-Covid era? So Ayman, I&#39;d like to start with you.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">46:14 &ndash; 46:50</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >I think for MENA, one of the interesting lessons learned and silver
        linings would be, you know, walking. Walking in the neighbourhoods,
        especially during the lockdown, you know, when people were allowed to
        move about a little bit locally.</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >This is now getting into a discussion about land use policies and so,
        there are I know efforts underway, for example, in Amman they&#39;re
        reviewing their licensing regulations so that they&#39;re allowing for
        more commercial opportunities that is well balanced within the local
        neighbourhoods.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">46:50 &ndash; 47:24</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >It&#39;s really created, you know, a sense of neighbourhood, if you
        will, that was missing--you know, people driving up their cars, parking
        their cars in their garages, going up to their apartments, doing the
        same, the reverse I guess, in the morning.</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >Now, there is a stronger sense of community and neighbourhood and more
        awareness about clean air. I mean, this is something we noticed across
        the globe, how people were marvelling at how clean the air, how blue the
        sky is, which is really giving us some inertia on cleaner modes.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">47:24 - 47:30</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So, I see in MENA the initiatives for buying and converting to electric
        buses have actually accelerated. There were some people, you know,
        raising questions about whether this is going to continue.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">47:31 &ndash; 48:25 </span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >&nbsp;The other, I think, interesting observation that that will take
        us into the future, related to what Dr Zhao mentioned, is that for many
        transit operators, dealing with the peak demand--serving the people at
        the most critical hour when they are going to work school, et cetera,
        and then going back home--that was very challenging, you know, to do and
        optimize the fleet, optimize the cost. And whatever you do at the level
        of service was not acceptable during peak periods. And now with these
        flexibilities that we&#39;re observing and implementing the technology
        and the flexibility, that gives some relief in a sense where some of the
        investments that would have gone to, you know, maybe expanding the fleet
        or the infrastructure can actually go to enhance the services.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">48:25 - 49:13</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >And finally, the observation that I have heard repeatedly through the
        different workshops and webinars we had with officials who are in the
        driver&#39;s seat for many public transport agencies, is that the
        investment that they made in technologies in the last 5 or 10 years has
        been tremendously crucial in their ability to succeed in dealing with
        the pandemic.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So, this is what defined the resilience of these systems, you know, how
        else can you change the routing of your buses? How else can you change
        the timing, the assignment of the drivers, with the push of a
        button?</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So we see this continuing in the future, there&#39;s a lot of
        inspiration for our systems in developing even emerging markets. You
        know that they are uptaking these technology applications.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">49:13 - 49:55</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">AS: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >So, I think, you know, when the future, I mean, when we&rsquo;re back
        to the new normal, or the next normal, I guess, however, it is
        defined</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5">mobility will still be there.</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >But, I think, you know, we go with, with a certain awareness that we
        gain from, from these past 12 months</span
      ><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >and, unfortunately, now, it seems 21; this is carrying some some of the
        unpleasant memories of 2020. The on-demand, the technology, the
        flexibility, I mean, we see this as something that will, that will
        continue with us, as part of this digitalization push that we have, we
        have begun to see over the last five years. It&rsquo;s become an
        integral part, as I&rsquo;ve said, of public transportation and urban
        mobility.</span

      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">49:58 &ndash; 50:19</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >Sure, yeah. I&#39;ll start with some simple examples.</span
      ><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >The first one was along with Ayman was saying the, the walking,
        cycling&hellip; Covid really pushed many people to go walking or cycle.
        I mean, if I goes to the local bicycle stores, they&rsquo;ve run out of
        stock. That&#39;s a big boost to them, right.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">50:19 &ndash; 50:48</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >And related to this land use and urban design change, there are also
        several cities where they close certain streets. And then allow the
        restaurant to set up a table outside and allow, basically pedestrianize
        the whole street, right. It turns out to be the case that local people
        love it, right? Why, why do we just do it in Covid? Let&#39;s do it
        forever, right? So, several of those things, I think, could be good
        examples of where we continue into the future.</span

    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c1">50:48 - 51:39</span
      ><span class="c3"><br /></span><span class="c2">JZ: </span
      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >The second one I also want to emphasize is that, what we learned during
        the process is, in terms of the decision maker in the process. Most of
        us, I think, we pay attention to the individual, right. So as an
        individual person, we make a decision on driving a car, taking a bus or
        walking. But the other one we often emphasize is the government, which
        sets up the infrastructure, build the roads, railway tracks, provide
        services, et cetera. But here, let me introduce the third decision
        maker, which is the companies and the employers. We actually find they
        play a critical role in influencing people&#39;s decisions. So very
        much, the individuals&#39; decisions are under the structure that the
        employer set up for them.

      ><span class="c3 c5"
        >Lastly, I&#39;ll just say, I read want the US agencies to look at the
        future with a growth mindset. Meaning, if you only look at today&#39;s
        finance, look at your budget, look at the driver, etc., you&#39;ll find
        that it&rsquo;s hopeless. What can I do, right? There&#39;s no money;
        either I reduce the services or I cut services. It&rsquo;s such a kind
        of a bad trade-off there.</span
