class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We&#39;re joined today by two inspirational ladies with outstanding expertise, please welcome Dr. Rabia Ferroukhi and Martha Broad.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rabia is the Deputy Director of the Knowledge, Policy, and Finance Division of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;She leads IRENA&#39;s Policy unit, which is responsible for a range of renewable energy policy issues, including design, socio economic benefits, and integrated resource management.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rabia brought to this position over 20 years of experience in the fields of energy, development and the environment having previously worked in both the public and private sectors.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Martha Broad is the Executive Director of the MIT Energy Initiative.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As part of the leadership team, she works to link science, innovation, and policy to transform the world&#39;s energy systems.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Welcome, ladies, and thank you for joining us today.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I would like to start with a general question to each of you.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>MMG:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Could you each give an introduction to your career path with some insights on how you have reached the successful positions you&#39;re both in today?</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If I could ask Dr Rabia to please start.</span><span><br><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thank you very, very much.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Also, for this question and the opportunity to share some insight that we have on gender issues, that IRENA, but, also, personally, on my own, let&#39;s say, journey.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, I&#39;m the director of the Knowledge, Policy and Finance division at IRENA and I think the underlying.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">My vision of the work we do for the past.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So we have done, for the past 10 years, is the aim to ensure that our analytical contribution to the field, and policy recommendations, we give to our member governments, really contributes to the deployment of renewable energy, but within a holistic framework.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Very often the energy transition towards a cleaner and more sustainable development has been technology oriented.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But given my multi-disciplinary background and approach to economic analysis, I have worked since the beginning, at looking at the socioeconomic structures really that underlie the energy transition.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This means basically looking at different pieces of the puzzle, their inter-linkages, which, really altogether, make up the sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And only then, can you ensure a successful,</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Just and equitable, let&#39;s say, transition.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;So, I started my career in the conventional sector, at OPEC specifically as an energy economist and slowly moved to climate change and renewables.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And I can assure you that things got much better from the times when I started.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And I would enter a meeting room or a conference with all men, or really a quasi-majority of men and had many incidents where it was taken for granted that I was the secretary ready to take orders for a taxi or for the meals or other similar tasks.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;I think we&#39;ve moved on from those times. There&#39;s still a lot to do.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But, as a labor and development economist, the gender dimension remains always at the heart of my work and my preoccupations.<br></span><span class="c1 c11"><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;And, as soon as I started at IRENA, for example, I tried to mainstream gender related aspects, be it in the analytical work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But, also, in the day-to-day, work with younger women, to try to mentor them, also, in terms of trying to push for a greater gender balance, in terms of recruitment and things like that.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I think another dimension, that remains for me quite important is the cultural specificities.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, obviously, I come from a multi-disciplinary, but also a multicultural background.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I come from two continents, Africa, Europe, Algeria, Czech Republic in terms of countries and was blessed also with living in several other countries and continents, including the US, and learning really a lot from other environments.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, I think it&#39;s with this background and vision, that I tried to continue to nourish the work that we do with my teams and support, sort of our holistic paradigm to serve the well-being of societies, and not stay isolated within the sort of technologically focused vision of the energy transition.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thank you Rabia. That&#39;s amazing. And I think the focus on a just transition and the socio-economic and multicultural vision, that you described, is definitely something that we all really need to be focusing on.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">Martha did, you have similar experiences, could you give us some insights into your career path, and how you&#39;ve arrived where you are today?</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Martha Broad: </span><span class="c2 c1">Sure, and that was really wonderful to hear from Rabia. Very, very exciting career path. </span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MB: </span><span class="c1">I&#39;m going to tell my story by really focusing more on the advocacy and the work I&#39;ve done.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And along the way, women have not only inspired me, but I do feel I&#39;ve had a great opportunity mentoring younger women.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And, I must say, that whenever you enter into a mentor relationship, you certainly learn from your mentee also.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: and I&#39;ve really found that to be wonderful.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: A bit about my path, which is, let&#39;s see&hellip; I&#39;ve been passionate about environment and energy issues since my college days, which is quite a bit ago.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And, 30 years ago, I graduated from business school, and I never thought I would go to business school.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: I&#39;d been working in a non-profit work in Washington, DC, for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: But, I went to the Yale School of Management, which encourages people to go from sector to sector throughout their career.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And I have done that. I landed into a eco-conscious candy company, believe it or not, a spin off of Ben and Jerry&#39;s, that combined sustainability and business.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And we were funded by Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry&#39;s because he wanted to go beyond where they had gone.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: We made a candy and we sourced Brazil nuts from the Amazon Rainforest from co-operatives.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: We created jobs there and in Vermont, we shared profits with rainforests advocacy organizations, and although we did not save the rainforest </span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: There are still issues there, but we feel like we educated people.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And, we really were one of the first eco-conscious consumer products companies back in the day.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, fast forward, a number of years.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: and I was recently part of the team at the quasi-public state agency in Massachusetts called the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center,</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: an organization that&#39;s focused on growing the clean energy economy with a real focus on jobs and innovation.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And one of the programs that I managed was working with universities to attract and leverage federal funding to support innovation, and getting products from lab to market.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And that is how I got to know the MIT Energy initiative or &lsquo;MITEI&rsquo;, as we call ourselves for short, and joined the executive team seven years ago.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: One of the first things that I got involved in there was helping to</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: continue a partnership that had just started with the Department of Energy around Clean Energy, Education, and Empowerment Programs.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And there we focus on mid-career women, and I would be happy to talk more about it.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: One of the unique things we do is we give awards to eight different mid-career women, women who have been out there and following a professional path for about 10 years.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: We also give a Lifetime Achievement Award. We&#39;re big believers in, not only giving these awards, but creating a network of women who can lift each other up and increase diversity throughout the sector. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">Thank you, Martha, for those insights.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">And I really loved hearing about your eco-conscious efforts in those so-called early days.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">And of course, we know that there&#39;s still a lot to do.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">I was also pleased to hear how you see mentoring as a two-way learning process.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">WICE, only this year, has launched its inaugural mentoring program, and so, we&#39;re only a few months into that, but I do hope that both mentors and mentees are already benefiting from that program.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And definitely, I do hope we can talk a little bit more about the mid-career program that you&#39;ve mentioned, I think ladies you are, of course, both role models in the sector, and I&#39;d like to move on and talk more about what your respective organizations are doing.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">So, Rabia if I could move back to you, if you could let us know a little about how IRENA supports and encourages women in the Clean Energy sector, please.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Thank you very much. I think I&#39;m going to start by saying that the gaps in gender data and the lack of data trends make it quite difficult to monitor progress for women and girls.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And unless gender is really mainstreamed into national economic strategies and prioritized in data collections.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I think challenges will remain in the analysis and the progress that we can sort of monitor.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">At IRENA, what we have done is contribute for the past 10 years, to the data analytical gap, by exploring the role of women in renewable energy.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And, as you may know, we have an annual review of jobs, looking at the sector worldwide since 2013, and currently, the sector employs about 11.5 million people at least in 2019.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Sorry, that&#39;s the latest we have, we just published it a few months ago.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And that may not seem much, but if you look at total employment in the overall energy sector, which is about 58 million, that&#39;s quite a big share.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">And we have really seen increasing trends over the years that we&#39;ve been monitoring this. Already in 2013</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">We had the first ever report on renewable energy and jobs, which included a dedicated chapter on women employment, and then we successively in the annual reviews that I just spoke about,</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">We integrated insights on the status of women&#39;s participation in the sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, for example, in the 2016 edition, we presented findings from an IRENA survey which resulted in the first quantification of the share of women in renewable energy sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And I&#39;d like to talk about this because everybody took that number as, you know, the official share of women in the renewable energy sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And I felt a little bit embarrassed because it was, you know, a very small survey, but we saw the interest, and this is why we, later, in 2019, launched our flagship report, renewable energy, a gender perspective, where we built a global survey of employees, companies, and institutions. It was, one of the most extensive surveys conducted on gender in renewable energy, to date. And it examines also the question of gender equity throughout the sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">Results found that renewables employ 32% women, interestingly enough, is not so far off from the small survey we had done earlier on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">This is, of course, much higher than what you find in oil and gas, which is about 22%, but well below the 44% you find in the economy as a whole.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">We did also, actually in 2017 a survey with CEBC and BNEF on the MENA region, where we looked also at specific challenges faced by women in the region, which we can talk about later on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Just to mention that, even looking at global renewable energy as such is, high disparities within different technologies.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">We did the, following the global survey, we did one on wind, which shows that the share of women is actually much lower, and closer to the, the one in oil and gas, it&#39;s about 21%. And this year, we&#39;re launching the solar PV sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, within that, I&#39;m just gonna mention, I can talk about this a bit further, because there&#39;s all sorts of granularity we can discuss in the key, some of these key findings in the global survey, in terms of STEM education, et cetera, But I&#39;ll leave that for later on. Just maybe to mention, that within IRENA, there&#39;s a clear effort to establish a gender balance in recruitment.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">We have over 50% women, staff, again, as most averages and you, this hides imbalance and disparities as far as the more senior professional levels are concerned.</span><span><br></span><span class="c1">But even there, I see some changes over the past couple of years with an increasing number of women in senior managerial positions.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">The last thing I would like to mention is that I&rsquo;m the gender focal point within IRENA </span><span><br></span><span class="c2 c1">and we do really make efforts to, together with, within IRENA and also with the global women&#39;s energy network for the energy transition of which I&#39;m part of, to continue mentoring. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;And Martha very impressive background, I fully agree with you. I think what I&rsquo;ve learned from the mentees, these young women is just invaluable, so maybe I&rsquo;ll get to some of the more detailed results that we get in terms of gender in the renewable energy sector later on. Thank you. </span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Thank you Rabia and it&#39;s good to hear that IRENAs commitment is also there internally within your organization in terms of gender balance.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">You mentioned, of course, the analytical gap and that is, of course, an ongoing concern, but the IRENA Annual Report, and the other reports and surveys that you mentioned do provide some very useful and insightful information and that does at least help fill part of that gap.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">I would hope that listeners, if they haven&#39;t read the IRENA reports, I would certainly recommend that they do.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">Look at the full reports, which I understand are available on IRENA&rsquo;s website. Is that right?</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">Yes of course, they are. You can download them for free and yeah, I think they would be very useful for people interested in the field. Definitely. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Thank you and it&rsquo;s also of course interesting, you know, you mentioned statistics, and it&rsquo;s always, I think sometimes easy just to look at the top level of those statistics but when you delve down into them and of course the differences when you mentioned that 32% participation of women in renewables but then that you could delve down into the different sectors within renewables, that wind for example the participation of women is much closer to what it is in conventional energy and that of course I think is very interesting and so, we don&rsquo;t have time today. I do recommend of course that people do look at the reports to delve down into those statistics and understand them a bit more. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Moving back to Martha, I think it would be interesting to find out how the MIT Energy Initiative work program, an effort to support and promote women in the sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You mentioned already, the initiatives that you have in relation to mid-career women and creating diversity in the sector, so it would be really interesting to find out more about that.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: You know, one of the areas, that I believe you mentioned when you kindly introduced the MIT Energy Initiative, that we focus on, is education. We work with students and we are really pleased that the undergraduates at MIT are almost 50/50 male and female, and are, you know, certainly, these younger women are arriving with a whole set of skills&mdash;that I think that </span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: some of us who graduated many years ago, were not quite as well trained in&mdash;confidence and the proactivity&mdash;back at that time.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, we do work with these young women, but I have to say, we&#39;re also working with the young men, and they&#39;re all very vibrant. At the graduate level,</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: I think that is where we see a much heavier skew&mdash;a smaller female/male balance.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And we have one person on our staff who teaches a Women in Leadership class that is frankly just an extracurricular seminar that she herself feels is really important, she&rsquo;s a former faculty member at a different school</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: and is part of our education team now and is an MIT PhD herself. So she really contributes that way.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: The undergrads, to bounce back to them for a second,</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: we&#39;re actually just starting a partnership with Columbia University and Tufts University, where each of our organizations does have , depending on the university, a small to large group of women in clean energy on campus. We&#39;re co-ordinating to provide job opportunity postings and certainly inviting each other to conferences focused on women in clean energy, etcetera.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, there&#39;s a collaboration there, and, frankly, you know, we have some ways to go.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: We are, up until now, very focused, on C3E, as our kind of major women in clean energy effort, and we do include students in that, too.</span><span><br></span><span class="c1">I should mention that one of the things we do is have a poster competition involving students from undergrad through graduate school, and actually even postdocs.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And that&#39;s a really wonderful part of the of the Symposium to every year.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And we handout five awards in that area.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, there&#39;s plenty of work to be done at those levels, I would say. And, I just want to mention, that, I think IRENA is playing an incredibly important role by gathering data about women in the sector, in the clean energy sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: I frankly find it, not that easy to find. But there are a few organizations that do look at, not only women across the sector, but women in senior roles.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And it&#39;s really striking that the percentages are much smaller there.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: As I&#39;m sure none of us are too shocked to hear, but I just reference Ernst and Young. They did a report with an index of Women in Power and Utilities and this one is a few years old that I&#39;ve got. I&#39;ve tried to find something more recent, but I&#39;m not optimistic that things have changed wildly. That is, in 2016, that 14% of senior management were women. And that itself had improved by 13% from the previous year. So, a little bit of a nudge up, but much work to be done. Well, even more troubling, I should say, is that women hold only 16% of the board positions in the sector&mdash;I&#39;m talking about power and utilities, not the clean energy&mdash;and that had only increased 1% than two years prior.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, at that rate, it would take 42 years to reach 30% women on board and 72 years to reach 40%, which is, way too long, obviously. So, we really also have a problem at a high level. &nbsp;And I would add that it&#39;s certainly not just about being fair or, you know, providing equity.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: It&#39;s actually, many of your listeners may know, it&#39;s a business opportunity. Ernst and Young. Bloomberg New Energy Finance did a report just about a month ago. And they looked at the past four years of the [oil and gas,] mining, and utilities sectors and they found that having </span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: 30% women on a board correlated positively with better climate governance and action in that area.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, you know, we have a huge energy transition to make as a globe, and it&#39;s clear that we need women at the table.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: Again, not just to be playing fair, but to increase our chances of success in that area. </span><span class="c1 c16">So I just wanted to mention that too, and again data gathering is really helpful and important in terms of measuring our progress.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG</span><span class="c1">: Thank you, Martha, and it does all sound quite inspirational in terms of all the different collaborative efforts that you have ongoing.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">And it&#39;s great to hear how you&#39;re targeting women already in the sector, but also graduates.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">And I absolutely agree. It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s still a lot to do. Not just because it&#39;s nice to have a gender balance, but because it also does make good sense. It makes good business sense. And one of the things that we do focus on in WICE is the need to encourage not just retention but also promotion of women.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">It&#39;s not just enough to have participation of women in the clean energy sector but we need to retain those women and we need to also make sure that there are opportunities for promotion.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Martha, if I could stay with you, with your work at the MIT Energy Initiative.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">And generally, based on your career experience, what would you say are the main challenges facing women in the clean energy sector in North America and generally?</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: This actually relates to the points we just, we just touched on, which is role models for women.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: Younger women coming up through, as I said, that there&#39;s so much potential there, and they&#39;ve really got.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: better opportunities, than, you know, 40 years ago.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And I think that I, myself, had a role model, not in clean energy, but it was my now 93-year old mother, who had five children.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: But, she was a math major and really quite, quite capable, and wanted to re-enter the workforce. And she did, and she went and earned a doctoral degree and started working.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And, frankly, as a child, I wasn&#39;t always appreciative of that, but I realized she and her female colleagues really provided me with a role model.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: There was no doubt that I would, move forward and, and achieve.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And so, I think that, that in itself is a challenge, and clearly, the numbers that we just looked at of women, executives, and board members are low.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: There are efforts underway, and I know that countries, and certainly, states in the US, have now actually mandated that, public companies have a certain number, a decent percent,</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: I think it&#39;s something like 30% women on boards. The role models are really, for me, the main thing, and I think that I should mention, with C3E, that we have women from many different disciplines related to clean energy and absolutely many different levels of careers. It&#39;s really quite a great chemistry that we create and it&#39;s an informal network, but it&#39;s certainly one that helps everybody at all levels.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">I think in terms of efforts, yes, agree, and there are efforts across the globe to try to increase the participation of women at a senior level and to make sure there are more role models out there but of course there efforts will take time to come to fruition. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;I just wanted to add one more thought, a real challenge that organizations face is insisting that when there&rsquo;s a job opportunity that women candidates be brought in, sought out and brought in and there&rsquo;s often an attitude of, oh well we just want the best people, but frankly with a little bit more effort and a little bit more focus, I think that, you know, absolutely the best candidates of both genders can be brought in. That&rsquo;s just one other challenge that I think, you know we don&rsquo;t mandate here in the US but I think that we should provide more direction and incentives to organisations to do that. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Well thank you for that and agreed again. I think we need to make sure that there are opportunities there for everyone, but obviously as I mentioned the focus on making sure there&rsquo;s that opportunity for retention and promotion, it&rsquo;s really quite critical. </span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rabia, could I ask you the same question as well with your work in IRENA and generally based on your career experience. What are the main challenges that you see facing women in Clean Energy in the MENA region and beyond? Do you see similar challenges to those, mentioned to Martha, or are there additional challenges perhaps in this region that may not be elsewhere?</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">You know, what is interesting is that we did this study as I told you with yourselves and being a few years ago, on the MENA region and then we just did this gender, global gender survey.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I mean, of course, I&#39;m not going to talk about the, the numbers now, as far as time is concerned, where women are less represented, versus administrative jobs, for example, or that women represent a very small fraction of the STEM positions, for example, in the industry.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">But what is interesting about boards surveys is that there is a qualitative part to, to which respondents answered, which is on barriers to entry, barriers to retention and advancement.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">The global survey, clearly shows that, both in the context of access and non-access, which we called modern.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, the analysis shows that the main barrier really relates to perception of gender roles.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">These are mainly entrenched, of course, in in cultural and social norms that that influence many of the fundamental decisions that people make.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">With the next and most important barrier, being prevailing hiring practices but also the way that workplaces are organized and the way they affect the work-life balance.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Of course, there&rsquo;s third barrier.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">You find the inadequate awareness about both STEM and non-STEM careers actually, in the sector, and the difficulties of accessing professional and personal networks.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, this is the entry barriers to entry, as far as the barriers to retention and advancement.<br></span><span class="c1 c11"><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">Of course, as, as Martha was mentioning, there are several studies speaking about the positive correlation between having a larger share of women and better governance, and which makes business sense.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">But obviously, the survey that we did found also that the glass tuning is the most important barrier.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">And in most of the participating private sector firms that we have results for, men represented at least 80% of board members.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">There are other barriers in terms of retention and advancement, including mobility requirements, often demanding work schedules, again, the lack of supportive, supportive workplace environment in terms of whatever flexible hours or family friendly measures, mentoring, etc.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I&#39;m going to relate it to the study we did on the MENA region, which is very much consistent with this global survey, and, where we find that person&#39;s perception of gender roles is a major barrier to entry. As some Respondents noted overt discrimination. One of the respondents even stated that: in the Gulf, the disparities in your face and I quote the employers most of the time instruct the recruiting agency to not only recommend male candidates. While others hinted that women have more difficulty participating in site work, they say that there is still the idea that women are not just capable of doing certain field jobs.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">The other specific aspect that is also in the global survey, in the MENA, was the shortage of STEM backgrounds.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">With the fewer women studying engineering, for example, and science, obviously reducing the number of women eligible in/for technical roles.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And one respondent clarified that renewable energy study is not presented socially as an option, for example.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, what is interesting, that is quite specific to the MENA region is the survey found that women&#39;s enrollment in higher education is actually very high.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">With the women representing about 50% of engineering graduates, they don&#39;t seem to either enter the labor force or if they do, they don&#39;t stay very long and that maybe has some cultural aspect to it that we could discuss.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And in terms of the barriers to retention and advancement, we found the same results as for the the global survey for the MENA.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">One was the glass ceiling or for advancement but also discrimination and pay which seemed to be significant.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Feature of women working in the MENA region, but we know it&#39;s true elsewhere as well.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And in the MENA region about a third of respondents believe that women in clean energy earn less than men for the same position. So, I think there are obviously cultural specificities there that we can discuss.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">But I feel that the overall, the general survey really reflects the characteristics or the important aspects of this issue with, at the heart really of this issue is the perception of gender roles.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thank you Rabia. Maybe I could just touch on one part of what you mentioned which was the barriers to entry in terms of prevailing workplace practices but that also a lack of a supportive workplace is an issue in terms of both retention and advancement. Do you think that the whole issue in terms or the issues around COVID and the increase in remote working that has occurred in the last 9 to 10 months, do you think that will help in terms of that?</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Or, do you feel, you know, particularly for there are things around, you know, site visits and so on, which obviously, does have its issues at the current, the current situation,</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Do you think that that, you know, will be something that people kind of forget after COVID or do you think it will help aid retention and advancement, as well as entry into the sector?</span><span class="c2 c0"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">That&#39;s a very good question. Mhairi, I really don&#39;t know, is the short answer, I just have anecdotal evidence and a few things. I mean, obviously, operations, reducing in the field for some of the renewable energy activity must have had some kind of, of impact, I think, overall, for both women and men. What I do know, from any anecdotal evidence, is that many women who have been working remotely, in the sector, have had great difficulties, actually sort of in terms of work-life balance? So, it&#39;s quite interesting because we do have issues with work-life balance, when we&#39;re at work. But, I think, when we&#39;re at home, with the homeschooling and all sorts of other tasks that are not always shared by the partners is, from some of the experiences that I&#39;ve heard, about has also been quite challenging. But I wouldn&#39;t know really, what the impact is.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And we haven&#39;t looked at it yet. We&#39;ve looked at many impacts of Covid in terms of the energy transition. But unfortunately, we haven&#39;t looked at that yet. But maybe Martha has more to say on that.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: That&#39;s great. I would love to jump in. COVID and mid-career tie in together, which is really interesting. One of the reasons that C3E focuses on mid-career, and this is of course pre-COVID, was because we were seeing that women do drop out, about 10 years in, and particularly in academia. But, absolutely, many different sectors and businesses. And in the US, I do not have the percentage, off the top of my head, but women have not only had trouble balancing, they have actually had to quit jobs.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And again, this is not clean energy, this is just across all women working in the US.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And of course, that&#39;s going to set them back to re-enter.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: You know, we&#39;re in an economic downturn.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: And that makes it tough and taking a break makes it tough also.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: It&#39;s interesting, in terms of the COVID-lens that we&#39;ve developed, I think, here in the US, we&rsquo;re, we&#39;re certainly optimistic that our new Leadership, as of January 20</span><span class="c1 c8">th</span><span class="c1">, is going to provide&mdash;well, first of all, our first woman, Vice President, and woman of color, Vice President, which is a huge achievement.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: And, again, we&#39;re going beyond clean energy, where we&#39;re talking about, you know, examples for people who are, both women and men, who are working in all sectors&mdash;but we did just do a session at C3E on the need.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: Well, and the absolute importance&mdash;we talk about gender diversity&mdash;</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: but certainly, the diverse approach to bringing everybody along and COVID made it really clear that we are leaving the working class, what we call the blue-collar workers, were suffering terribly.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And, you know, being laid off all the sandwich shops and restaurants around MIT have closed down for now.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>MB</span><span class="c2 c1">: Because the campus, has essentially been closed for months, and then, a very slow ramp up for our laboratory now.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, I guess that that, the need for, especially in clean energy, not just the workforce, but the policies and the impact, and the affordability, and all of those issues, I think, are going to get a lot more focus than they have.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And I think the timing is right for you, policy makers and leaders, both at the state and federal level, to step up and, make the clean energy transition, also, a just transition.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Thank you, Martha, and thank you, Rabia, and I think it&rsquo;s very apt that you said, you know, the time is ripe for policymakers to step up and, you know, we&#39;re looking for exactly that, a just transition.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Maybe I could just finish off then with one final question to each of you and it is related to that.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">Mhairi</span><span class="c1">: What are your top three recommendations for policymakers, for decision makers in the clean energy sector and so, firstly for those and also secondly, for, for women entering already in the sectors? So, what are your top three recommendations? If we could start with Martha please?</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: Ok, my top three recommendation well, I re-iterate. An improved focus on recruiting a diverse workforce, and again, I think we have to go beyond just gender diversity. It&#39;s clear in the US that there&#39;s also a racial diversity problem and a class problem.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: So, you know, I think carrots or sticks from the government&mdash;I would prefer incentives to punishment for all sectors, not just the private sector, but the public and non-profit and private sectors.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: I think that my second priority is, for us to look out in our daily lives for women that we can help along, professionally and, we all lead very busy lives,</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: but just making the extra time to mentor.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: Because, as we&rsquo;ve already talked about, it certainly is a two-way street, and we have our own personal and professional development that goes along with being a mentor.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: And my last one I think it really is to continue to collaborate with other women in clean energy organizations, I feel like it&#39;s obvious that there are many different organizations out there doing great things </span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: and I think that we have a big challenge with the clean energy transition and clearly a big challenge with increasing gender diversity and racial diversity, and that it would be great to spend more time coordinating. It&#39;s wonderful to meet both of you and to hear about your organizations and the work that you&#39;re doing</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MB</span><span class="c1">: and I would love to be part of an effort to, to bring together those organizations that are existing and, working hard throughout the globe.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c2 c1">Thank you, Martha. I think that&#39;s really fantastic. Rabia, could you give me your top three recommendations?<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">Yes, of course. Thank you. It&#39;s always hard to choose three, but I&#39;m going to try.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I mean, given the barriers to entry I spoke about, but also, I guess for retention and advancement in terms of the perception of gender rules, which are unchanged in cultural and social norms.<br></span><span class="c1 c11"><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I would say that one, the first one I would choose, is raising awareness about this sort of centrality of gender equality.<br></span><span class="c1 c11"><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And have increased participation of women in the energy transition at different levels.<br></span><span class="c1 c11"><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And that can go through many different means.<br></span><span class="c0"><br>RF: </span><span class="c2 c1">But I just want to give you an example from just, from the analytical work that we do, and, and our engagement with countries, et cetera.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I, one example that I&#39;d like to give is that, once we did the gender study, Vestas cited the findings in the Wind energy survey, we did, and announced that they pledged to increase measures to improve the company&#39;s performance in diversity.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And, and safety, including targets for female leadership, and as, and they even included, if I remember, correctly, a review of pay equity between men and women.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, that was quite a, success we felt. So, that would involve, of course, at the policy level, all sorts of different measures to introduce. The one would be raising awareness.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">I think another one would be fostering, basically.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Women&#39;s economic empowerment, because we&#39;re speaking really, mostly by the modern sector here, but whether in the access context, it&#39;s, it&#39;s even more acute, the access of women to financing and etc., is really, really important barrier.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, in increasing access to investments, and capacity building, for example, in entrepreneurship, it would be very important.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">One example, which is not, it, goes beyond renewable energy, but I think is quite telling is, that, I see, for example, is, it is helping to improve access to finance for smaller businesses in Lebanon.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And only 3% of bank loans go to female entrepreneurs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">So, there&#39;s really something to do there in terms of access to finance and, and assets for women to, to really do things, especially I would say, in the, in the access context, But it&#39;s true also in the modern sector.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Then, the last one I would choose is, is, is sharing experiences and best practices related to, to policies and other initiatives that have encouraged women, or promoted women&#39;s participation, leadership, et cetera</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And as mentioned by, Martha, this, can really be supported by creating supportive networks.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">Mentorship arrangements, leveling the playing field for gender.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">And there&#39;s many examples, there&#39;s WICE of course, there&#39;s the C3E, there&#39;s also GWNET.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">RF: </span><span class="c1">There&#39;s many things. Many different platforms that are doing this, and I think greater effort, is needed in this field.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Thank you Rabia. Gosh, How do I sum up? We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground today. A lot of messages certainly, I think, for our listeners to take away. Raising awareness, fostering woman&#39;s empowerment, breaking barriers, availability of role models. And above all, I think, the message that we&rsquo;ve probably all discussed, and we would all agree on, is that there&#39;s a need for a just transition.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Thank you, Dr. Rabia Farroukhi of IRENA </span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG</span><span class="c1">: and Martha of the MIT Energy Initiative for your valuable insights, and taking the time today to share your experiences, your expertise, and your advice. It&#39;s really very much appreciated.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">I said at the start, we were joined by two inspirational, ladies with outstanding expertise, and I&#39;m sure our listeners will agree with this, so thank you.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">Finally, on behalf of CEBC and WICE, I would like to thank the sponsor for this episode, The Hollings Center for International Dialogue, a non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to fostering dialogue between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Eurasia and Europe.

This brings to an end of the final session in the Women in Clean Energy Spotlight program series. We&#39;ve had 13 outstanding woman leaders from across the globe sharing their insights, success stories, and initiatives, throughout the series of 12 episodes.</span><span><br></span><span class="c1">We&#39;re very excited to announce our second season of CEBC&#39;s podcast series, is launching next week, And will be focused on the future of mobility, in partnership with the MIT Energy Initiative and sponsored by the Hollings Center for International Dialogue.</span><span><br><br></span><span class="c0">MMG: </span><span class="c1">The future mobility season will cover topics on transportation electrification, alternative fuels, shared mobility, autonomous vehicles, public transportation, and the impact of Covid 19 on mobility. So, stay tuned. Thank you.</span><span><br></span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><div><p class="c10 c13"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p></div></body></html>
